# Hardware-Image-Decompressor
 Implementation of a hardware-based image decompression system on a DE2-115 FPGA using VHDL, integrating UART communication, SRAM memory, and VGA display modules to decode and render images in real time. Includes designed finite state machines and digital datapaths for color space conversion, inverse transforms, and image reconstruction.
