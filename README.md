# Hardware-Image-Decompressor
This project implements a fully hardware-based image decompressor for the custom .mic19 image format, developed in SystemVerilog and deployed on an FPGA. The design handles the complete decompression pipeline in hardware, from compressed bitstream parsing to real-time VGA display output.

The system interfaces with external memory and peripherals, demonstrating end-to-end digital system design, hardware control logic, and data-path optimization.
